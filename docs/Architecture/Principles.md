# Architecture Principles

## Consider Security Throughout

Security is a first-class citizen, and must be considered from the start, and throughout, the entire development lifecycle.

## Cost Effective Design

Costs must be optimised to maximise return on investment.

## Design for Growth

Solutions must be able to grow as demand increases.

## Maintainability

Tech-Debt must be minimised to ensure consistent rates of delivery.

## User-Centric Design

Systems must be focused on the users needs, offering first-of-class accessibility and usability.

## Compliance & Standards

Adhere to relevant industry standards, legal regulations, and organizational policies to avoid risks and ensure compatibility.

## Interoperability

Allow the solution to integrate seamlessly with other systems, using standardized protocols and APIs.

## Favour Automation & Reusability

Design solutions to minimise duplication of functionality and effort.
