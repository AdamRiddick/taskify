# Governance

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR's)

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are structured documents that capture key architectural decisions made during a project. They outline the context, reasoning, and consequences of these decisions, ensuring transparency and providing a historical record for future reference. ADRs help teams maintain consistency and facilitate informed decision-making.

All ADRs must follow the [ADR Template](/Decision Records/000-Template.md).

## Architecture Review Board (ARB)

The Architecture Review Board (ARB) is a governance body responsible for overseeing architectural standards and practices within an organization. It ensures that architectural decisions align with strategic goals, fosters collaboration across teams, and mitigates technical risks. The ARB typically reviews and approves major design proposals, providing guidance and ensuring compliance with organizational policies & architectural principles.

Proposals must contain the following information as a bare minimum;

- Problem Statement
- Overview & Scope of Solution
- Constraints & Drivers
- Team
- Design Artifacts (As-Is, To-Be, Threat Model)
- Architecture Principles Summary detailing how the principles are being met, and any exceptions.

## As-Is Packs

As-Is packs summarise a product, providing a high-level overview of the current state of the system. These should be updated regularly, keeping up-to-date with any key changes made from the outcome of ADRs or ARB's.

The format of As-Is packs is a series of C4 Diagrams.

## SDLC

The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a framework that defines the processes and phases involved in developing, deploying, and maintaining software. It typically includes stages such as planning, requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Adopting a structured SDLC ensures quality, reduces risks, and promotes efficient delivery of software solutions.
