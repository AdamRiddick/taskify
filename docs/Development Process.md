# Development Process

## Roadmap

Roadmapped items are fleshed out once feasibility has been established. Deadlines must be highlighted, considering that an MVP may be produced with further features added later.

## Design

Delivery must also be considered at this stage.

Outputs:

- Scope
- Technical pre-requisites
- Functional Gaps Identified
- Estimate for delivery
- Check-Ins scheduled

## Development

The work undergoes development, following regular check-ins to remove any blockers and get early feedback from the product owner(s).

## Review & Acceptance Testing

Once complete, work is reviewed before being enabled for customers. This can be release behind a feature toggle, however it must be reviewed to ensure the goals are met and the UI/UX meets standards.
