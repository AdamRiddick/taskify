# Taskify

A team-oriented task management platform designed for mid-size organizations. The system emphasizes collaboration, reporting, and scalability, showcasing hybrid architecture with Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD).

## Goals

Taskify is a learning exercise and exploration into architectural concepts in a real-life scenario. It's likely that sections of this solution are over-engineered for the sake of exploring differing technology types, and in a real-world product deeper consideration should be made over which techniques to follow.
